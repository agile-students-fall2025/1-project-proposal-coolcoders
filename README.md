# Project Proposal

Project Title: CommYOUnity

What?

 Are you an international student looking to make friends with a similar heritage, or are you just interested in reconnecting with your family's cultural roots? Then CommYOUnity is the perfect place for you. CommYOUnity is an app designed to make it easy for you to find your people. Being far from home is never easy, but CommYOUnity can bring home closer to you!


Why?

 Many, if not all, international students face impostor syndrome when they first arrive in the US. Moreover, almost all international students deal with "Freshman depression." All of these are symptoms of being alone in a new culture. On the other hand, the US is known for its rich diversity, with people from all sorts of backgrounds. However, it's often hard to find "your people" in a busy place like NYC. I believe a centralized app where you can join a community group chat from your cultural background would help both international students who are trying to navigate a new place while struggling with homesickness, and people who are just looking to reconnect to their heritage, come together. We spend most of our time on social media anyway, so why not create a social media platform that can form long-lasting friendships, too?


For whom?

CommYOUnity is designed for international students and people who have either immigrated or are from an immigrant family and are looking to reconnect with their culture. While that is its target audience, CommYOUnity can also be used by "allies" who are curious to learn more about different cultures.

In this stage, CommYOUnity will be limited to people within the NYC metropolitan area.


How?

CommYOUnity is like a social media designed specifically to find "your community." When a user creates their account, they are asked to specify which community board of a particular nationality they would like to join. If there is no community board started yet, they can choose to create one, or simply browse through the community boards that already exist. 

This "browse" part will work similarly to a regular social media feed. The user will scroll to see all available communities and a brief description of each community. If the user is interested in joining a community they can click the "join" button next to the community. Inside each community board, users can post their thoughts, share events, and communicate with all members of the community. 

In terms of user interface, there will be 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen - one on the left (the "browse" button, where the user can browse available communities), one in the center (the "add" button, where the user can create a new community), and one on the right (the "YOU" button, where the user can see and browse all of the communities they're already in). If a user decides they no longer want to be part of a community, they would simply tap the "exit" button.

In terms of the personal profile, other than the username, each user can choose to add a photo, a description of themselves, and some interests that they have. 


Scope

Given the fact that NYU has a pretty big international student body, I think it would be easy to kick off a beta version of this app early and start testing the app's features. I also don't think extending it to the NYC Metropolitan Area is too far of a reach, since this app targets a pretty specific part of the population. All in all, I believe this project is feasible, as the structure is not overly complex, and it would be easy to form an initial sample audience for the app.
